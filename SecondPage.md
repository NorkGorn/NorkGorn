## Cheesy Surprise

#### *I'm unsure what else to say about myself so I thought I'd just make something*  

I thought I'd talk about one of my greatest passions: **CHEESE**  

One of my favorite pages to visit is the [Wikipedia page for cheese.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese)
Cheese is defined as 
"*a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. 
It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep.*"
